    "Softmax Regression is a simple classifiers using tf environment. The nomenclature used is often $w_i^j$, where $w$ is a vector; $i$ is the indice of the vector; $j$ is the class that $w$ represents. Finally, $W$ is the database of $[w^a...w^z] \\forall j \\in [a,...,z]$ avaliable classes. This softmax regression is used to train MNIST benchmark, whgihc has 9 classes as follows. To train a neural network using MNIST data base and using softmax, one may transform the image $[28x28]$ into a flaten vector of $[1 x 784]$. Thus the position of the pixels (black or white) does not matter anymore in the training. Softmax neural network has 9 outputs, one for each class, and they store the probability to the input being from such class. The most probable class must be taken. See figure below:\n",

    "Supervised learning generally refers to the task of learning a function from data objects to labels associated with them, based on a set of examples where the correct labels are already known. This is usually subdivided into the case where labels are continuous (regression) or discrete (classification). \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of training supervised learning models is almost always to apply them later to new examples with unknown labels called inference phase, in order to obtain predicted labels for them. In the MNIST case discussed in this section, the purpose of training the model would probably be to apply it on new handwritten digit images and automatically find out what digits they represent.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we are interested in the extent to which our model will label new examples correctly. This is reflected in the way we evaluate the accuracy of the model. We first partition the labeled dataset into train and test partitions. During model training, we use only the train partition, and during validation we test the accuracy only on the test partition. This scheme is generally known as a train/test validation.\n",

    "The actual training of the model, in the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach, consists of taking many steps in “the right direction.” The SGD optimizer used in this example is Adam.
