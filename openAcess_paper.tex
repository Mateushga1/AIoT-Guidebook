\hypertarget{learning-goals}{%
\subsection{1. Learning Goals}\label{learning-goals}}

The goal of this tutorial is to design various Internet of Things (IoT) applications through experimentation, creation, and validation of functional projects. By combining technological insights with practical, hands-on project-based learning, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the components that make up a connected system, ranging from sensor selection to data processing in cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

We will use different electronic development boards along with two development environments: \textit{MBed OS} and \textit{STM32CubeIDE}. Each section of this tutorial will be dedicated to teaching essential concepts of both development environments, IoT implementations, ThingSpeak cloud, and embedded AI. These tutorials are designed to inspire you to implement your own projects.

This material covers several key areas. First, it focuses on electronic design and integration, involving the selection and integration of sensors and other electronic components. Next, it addresses processing and communication, which includes programming in C, processing on the embedded board, and implementing communication protocols. The tutorial also delves into the implementation of AI, where you will learn to use pre-trained AI models in your embedded projects. Finally, it also explores data processing and application on a server via ThingSpeak, covering data handling and visualization on a cloud-based server.

The project involves multiple steps, including specifying a connected object and a target application by describing the needs and functionalities, assembling and integrating different elements to create the object, focusing on hardware design involving sensors and the processor board, integrating the hardware with AI to determine if your model can be implemented into your project and understanding its limitations, and developing the application and its cloud environment with a focus on software design involving data processing and visualization.

\subsubsection{2.1 B-L475E-IOT01A Development
Board}\label{b-l475e-iot01a-development-board}}

For the first part of this material, we will use the board referenced a \textit{B-L475E-IOT01A}. It (Fig. \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Board}) features an \textit{STM32L475VGT6} microcontroller, memory, sensors, radio frequency modules allowing for wireless connections, two USB connections, a connector for Arduino extensions, and two microphones. Thus, it constitutes a complete system for developing a connected object. Additionally, it is possible to add external sensors or radio frequency modules to enhance its functionalities. Its dimensions are 90mm x 60mm. It is assembled using SMD components placed on both sides (Fig. \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Top} and \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Bottom}). Its functional description is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Pinout} with all the peripherals.

\end{figure}

The microcontroller integrates 3 serial interfaces, 2 serial audio interfaces, 1 analog-to-digital converter, 1 I2C port, 1 USB connection, and 1 digital input/output port (GPIO). Its core is a 32-bit ARM RISC microprocessor with a power of 100 DMIPS (Dhrystone Million Instructions Per Second).

The board (Fig. \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Top}, \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Bottom} and \ref{fig:B-L475E-IOT01A-Pinout}) includes a 3-axis magnetic induction sensor (+/-16 gauss = +/-16e-4T), a 3-axis acceleration sensor (+/-16g), and a 3-axis gyroscope (+/-2000¬∞/s). It features a pressure sensor (260-1260hPa), a temperature sensor (+/-0.5¬∞C), and a humidity sensor (0-100\% relative humidity, accuracy +/-3.5\%). Additionally, it has a motion and time-of-flight sensor (<2m) based on an infrared laser, and an authentication and security sensor.

The board includes 4 radio frequency modules:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item a Bluetooth module (V4.1), 
 \item a WiFi module (802.11 b/g/n),
 \item an NFC tag communication module,
 \item a sub-GHz 868MHz module.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{2.2 B-U585I-IOT02A Development
Board}\label{b-u585i-iot02a-development-board}}

For the last section, that is where we will implement machine learning models into our projects, we will use the developer board \textit{B-U585I-IOT02A}, as it offers 2 Mbytes of Flash memory (twice as much as the model used previously) and 786 Kbytes of SRAM (more than six times greater than the previous model). These two parameters are crucial when deciding which microcontroller to use because they are the primary factors that limit edge applications. Typically, models require a significant amount of memory to perform their calculations.

The enhanced memory capacity of the \textit{B-U585I-IOT02A} makes it an excellent choice for developing embedded AI solutions, allowing for more complex and efficient machine learning models to be implemented directly on the device. This capability is essential for achieving high performance and independence in edge AI applications.

The board supports multiple connectivity options such as a Wi-Fi¬Æ module (802.11 b/g/n compliant) from MXCHIP and Bluetooth¬Æ Low Energy from STMicroelectronics. Additionally, it is equipped with various MEMS sensors, including a 3-axis magnetometer, 3D accelerometer, 3D gyroscope, pressure sensor, relative humidity and temperature sensor, time-of-flight and gesture-detection sensor, and an ambient-light sensor. It also includes two digital microphones and a security/authentication module for IoT devices.

Connectivity is further enhanced by the inclusion of multiple board connectors: USB Type-C¬Æ, ARDUINO¬Æ Uno V3 expansion connectors, a camera module expansion connector, two STMod+ expansion connectors, and a Pmod‚Ñ¢ expansion connector. The board offers flexible power supply options, including ST-LINK USB VBUS, USB connector, or external sources. An on-board STLINK-V3E debugger/programmer provides USB re-enumeration capability, mass storage, Virtual COM port, and a debug port.

Fig. \ref{fig:B-U585I-IOT02A-Board}, \ref{fig:B-U585I-IOT02A-Top} and \ref{fig:B-U585I-IOT02A-Bottom} show the board, top and bottom peripherals respectively:

\hypertarget{chapter-2-exploring-mbed-os}{%
\section{Chapter 2: Exploring MBed
OS}\label{chapter-2-exploring-mbed-os}}

As mentioned earlier, we will start with \textit{MBed OS}, due to the points raised, so we will go through the initial setup steps of the environment, basic examples of how to create your projects, use sensors, interface them with the board, and perform communication protocols.

\hypertarget{installation-and-setup}{%
\subsection{1. Installation and Setup}\label{installation-and-setup}}

Before starting to program our MCU, we need to install our environment, the driver and update the board, so:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Connect the board to your PC via one of the USB ports: \texttt{USB-STLink}. The simplest way to power the board is by using the 5V from the USB. To do this, place a jumper on JP4 on the \texttt{5V\_ST\_LINK} pins in your board.

  \item Then, install the necessary driver in your PC and restart it. This driver is available in:
  
  \begin{center}
    \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/setup/en.stsw-link009.zip}{\faFolder\texttt{\ setup/en.stsw-link009.zip}}
  \end{center}

  \item Once the driver is installed, the board appears as a D drive in your PC. Open this drive and check the \texttt{Details.txt} file. If the BIOS version seems outdated, it is preferable to update it. To do this, download the file to update the board and run the executable. When the window appears, click on \texttt{Device connect} to verify the BIOS version. If the BIOS version is older than the one provided, click on \texttt{Yes >>>>>} to update to the new BIOS. The program is available in:
  
  \begin{center}
    \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/setup/Bios_update_ST.zip}{\faFolder\texttt{\ setup/Bios\_update\_ST.zip}}
  \end{center}
  
  \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/1.png}
      \caption{Updating the BIOS of the board.}
  \end{figure}

  \item \textbf{Installation of \textit{Mbed Studio}}: This software is available at \url{https://os.mbed.com/studio/} for Windows, Mac, and Linux. The installation is straightforward by executing the provided program. Once installed, the software will prompt you to create an account to use the programming environment. If it identifies outdated drivers or BIOS versions on the board, it may ask you to authorize updates.

  \item \textbf{An alternative to installing \textit{Mbed Studio}} is using the \textit{Keil Arm} online programming interface, available at \url{https://studio.keil.arm.com/}. The same \textit{MBed} account can be used across all environments.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{example-blinking-a-led}{%
\subsection{2. Example Blinking a LED}\label{example-blinking-a-led}}

Using the board involves running executable software on it. Therefore, applications need to be developed in the form of executables for the board. This requires using a specific development system, which interfaces with the \textit{MBed OS} operating system running on the ARM microcontrollers. This development system includes several sample source codes (in C language) that can be easily modified to create a specific application.

We will implement a very simple first example: the blinking LED.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Start the software}, create your account, and configure your working directory.
  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Once this is done, all projects will be located in this directory.
    \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Create a new project} by importing an example program:
  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Navigate to \textbf{File -> New Program}.
      \item A selection window will appear, choose \textbf{\textit{mbed-os-example-blinky}}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/2.png}
    \end{figure}

  \item \textbf{Configure the program}:
  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Next, you can give the project a name, such as \texttt{mbed-LED1}.
      \item Make the program active.
      \item For the first program, save the \textit{Mbed} environment in your directory.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/3.png}
    \end{figure}

  \item Click on \textbf{ADD\_PROGRAM} to complete the setup.
\end{enumerate}

The program appears on the right side of the environment. To make a project active later, right-click on it and select \texttt{Set Active Program}. The name of the active program will then appear in bold among the different projects.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/4.png}
\end{figure}

You can open the corresponding code by clicking on the \texttt{main.cpp} file:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"

// Blinking rate in milliseconds
#define BLINKING_RATE     500ms

int main()
{
    // Initialize the digital pin LED1 as an output
#ifdef LED1
    DigitalOut led(LED1);
#else
    bool led;
#endif

    while (true) {
        led = !led;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(BLINKING_RATE);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
  \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/chapter-2/mbed-LED1/main.cpp}{\faFolder\texttt{\ chapter-2/mbed-LED1/main.cpp}}
\end{center}

\texttt{led} is an object of the \texttt{DigitalOut} class. \texttt{LED1} is the name of the pin on the board, which is passed to the \texttt{DigitalOut} constructor. \texttt{LED1} and \texttt{LED2} are green LEDs located between the two USB interfaces, on the left and right respectively. \texttt{LED3} is a yellow LED located below the WiFi module on the left. \texttt{LED4} is a blue LED at the bottom right, near the MEMS microphones. The \texttt{led} object can take two binary values: '1' or '0'. The \textit{MBed OS} function \texttt{sleep\_for} allows the process to sleep for a specified time in milliseconds. The use of the \texttt{while (true)} loop ensures that the main program runs indefinitely, which is necessary for embedded IoT applications deployed in the field. Once turned on, the IoT device executes its main program continuously.

To compile and download the code to the board, click on the compile icon. The first compilation takes a long time because all the libraries are compiled. For subsequent compilations, only the main program \texttt{main.cpp} will be recompiled. If you make significant modifications, you can invoke the \texttt{Clean Build} mode, which functions like the first compilation and takes a lot of time.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/5.png}
\end{figure}

Note that whenever you modify the configuration or environment files, the entire project needs to be recompiled. Check that the LED blinks with a period of 1 second.

Now, let's add a second LED and display a message at startup.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"

// Blinking rates in milliseconds
#define BLINKING_RATE 500ms

int main() {
    // Initialize the digital pins LED1 and LED2 as outputs
    DigitalOut led1(LED1);
    DigitalOut led2(LED2);
    led1=0 ; led2=1 ;

    // Display a message at startup
    printf("Starting LED blink program\n");

    while (true) {
        led1 = !led1;
        led2 = !led2;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(BLINKING_RATE);
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

When the program starts, a new tab appears in the bottom right section of the tool, allowing you to display the results of \texttt{printf} functions as shown below. You can extend this example with \texttt{LED3} according to your needs. The LEDs on the board can serve as a visual indicator for the operation of the application being developed in the project.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-3cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/6.png}
\end{figure}

\begin{center}
  \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/chapter-2/mbed-LED2/main.cpp}{\faFolder\texttt{\ chapter-2/mbed-LED2/main.cpp}}
\end{center}

\hypertarget{example-using-the-boards-internal-sensors}{%
\subsection{3. Example Using the Board's Internal
Sensors}\label{example-using-the-boards-internal-sensors}}

The available development board already has several integrated sensors that are used to showcase the various applications that can be performed using it.

This time, we will create an empty project and import all the necessary libraries.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Create a New Project}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Go to \textbf{File -> New Program}, then choose \textbf{mbed6 empty Mbed program}, and click on \textbf{Add Program}.
    \end{itemize}

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \item \textbf{Add Internal Board Sensor Libraries}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Return to \url{https://os.mbed.com/code/}.
        \item Click on the previously chosen project.
        \item At the top of the page, you will see a dependency on the \textit{BSP\_B-L475E-IOT01} library.
        \item Right-click on the library name to copy its address.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]

        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Import the library into the project by going to \textbf{File -> Add Library to Active Program}.
        \item Paste the address into the window.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Click on \textbf{Finish}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Add Code to the Program}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Copy the code found in \texttt{chapter-2/internal-sensors/main.cpp} into your \texttt{main.cpp}.
        \item Compile and upload the program to the board.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{See Results}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You might notice that floating point numbers are not displayed correctly. This is because by default, \textit{MBed OS 6} does not handle floating point printing to reduce code size.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-5cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/14.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

To enable this functionality:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Open the \texttt{mbed\_lib.json} file in the path \texttt{chapter-2/internal-sensors/mbed-os/platform} of your project.
    
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/15.png}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \item Look for the section:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}[style=JsonStyle]
"minimal-printf-enable-floating-point": {
    "help": "Enable floating point printing when using minimal printf library",
    "value": false
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    \item Change \texttt{"value": false} to \texttt{"value": true}.
    \item Recompile the entire project. Unfortunately, the system performs a complete recompilation because a system file has been modified and that can take a while to finish, so always pay attention to the configurations you want before compiling your project.
\end{enumerate}

Now, you can verify that the floating point numbers are displayed correctly.

\subsection{4. Sensors Tutorial}\label{sensors-tutorial}}

For this section, we will use a kit containing various sensors and components, which is extremely useful for those starting in the world of microcontrollers due to the wide range of projects and applications in which they can be used. But you can use your own sensor and components that you have available.

This kit includes over twenty sensors (such as position, light, magnetic, and temperature sensors) and around ten actuators (including LEDs, relays, buzzers, and lasers). Another positive aspect of this kit is the availability of content on the internet regarding its use with various other microcontrollers, which can serve as a foundation for your projects.

\textbf{Types of Sensor Outputs:}

Sensors can provide different types of outputs:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Analog Voltage:} These sensors output a varying voltage and need to be connected to ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) inputs.
    \item \textbf{Digital Signal:} These sensors output a binary signal (high or low) and should be connected to digital inputs.
\end{enumerate}

Some more complex sensors communicate via serial communication, requiring the use of an appropriate driver.

\hypertarget{list-of-available-sensors-and-actuators}{%
\subsubsection{4.1 List of Available Sensors and
Actuators}\label{list-of-available-sensors-and-actuators}}

Here is the list of available sensors and actuators (Table \ref{table:sensors-actuators}), along with the type of signal to use. For actuators (A), the inputs are either digital (D) or PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). For sensors (S), the information can be analog (A), digital (D), or more complex, in which case the appropriate driver must be used.

Next, we will demonstrate the implementations of some of these sensors so that you have the basic knowledge needed to create your own projects using them or the other ones.

\hypertarget{joystick-sensor}{%
\subsubsection{4.2 Joystick Sensor}\label{joystick-sensor}}

This sensor, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:joystick}, provides two analog voltages (joystick position in X/Y) and a digital voltage (push button). The X and Y position signals should be connected to the A0 and A1 ports of the processor board, the Switch signal to the D8 input, and GND to ground. However, the 5V signal should be connected to the 3.3V pin on the board. This is because the analog-to-digital converter on the ST board operates between 0 and 3.3V. If powered with 5V, the X and Y signals will exceed the allowed limit.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/joystick.jpg}
    \caption{Joystick Sensor.}
    \label{fig:joystick}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

You can use the following program to test the joystick. This program displays the joystick's status every second and lights up the LED based on the push button status.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"

AnalogIn analog_value0(A0);
AnalogIn analog_value1(A1);

DigitalIn pb(D8);
DigitalOut led(LED1);

int main()
{
    float meas_r0, meas_r1;
    float meas_v0, meas_v1;
    int but;

    printf("\nJoystick example\n\r");

    while(1) {
        meas_r0 = analog_value0.read();
        // Read the analog input value (value from 0.0 to 1.0 = full ADC conversion range)
        meas_v0 = meas_r0 * 3300;
        // Converts value in the 0V-3.3V range
        meas_r1 = analog_value1.read();
        // Read the analog input value (value from 0.0 to 1.0 = full ADC conversion range)
        meas_v1 = meas_r1 * 3300;
        // Converts value in the 0V-3.3V range
        but = pb;

        // Display values
        printf("measure x= %f = %.0f mV y= %f = %.0f mV %d \n\r", meas_r0, meas_v0, meas_r1, meas_v1, but);

        // LED is ON when the button is pushed
        led = pb;

        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // 1 second
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{center}

\hypertarget{multicolor-led}{%
\subsubsection{4.3 Multicolor LED}\label{multicolor-led}}

There are two LED modules available, one with a standard LED (Fig. \ref{fig:LED-TH}) and one with a surface-mounted LED (Fig. \ref{fig:LED-SMD}).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \subfigure[\label{fig:LED-TH}]{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/LED_TH.png}}
    \subfigure[\label{fig:LED-SMD}]{\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{images/LED_SMD.png}}
    \caption{Multicolor LED: standard mounting (a) and surface mounting (b).}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Connect the Red, Green and Blue inputs of the module to the D9, D10, and D11 outputs of the board and ground to a ground point. The first program controls the Red, Green, and Blue components of the LED separately. We have seven possible colors. In the provided program, we alternately see black, the three primary colors, and white.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"

DigitalOut R(D9);
DigitalOut G(D10);
DigitalOut B(D11);

int main()
{
    printf("\n\r LED example ON/OFF\n\r");

    while(1) {
        R = 0; G = 0; B = 0;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
        R = 1; G = 0; B = 0;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
        R = 0; G = 1; B = 0;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
        R = 0; G = 0; B = 1;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
        R = 1; G = 1; B = 1;
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The second program uses PWM generators to control the intensity of the three colors.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"

PwmOut R(D9);
PwmOut G(D10);
PwmOut B(D11);

int val;

int main()
{
    printf("\n\r LED example with PWM\n\r");

    while(1) {
        R.write(0); G.write(0); B.write(0);
        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second

        for (val = 0; val <= 1000; val++) {
            R.write((double)val / 1000.0);
            ThisThread::sleep_for(10ms); // wait 0.01 second
        }

        for (val = 0; val <= 1000; val++) {
            G.write((double)val / 1000.0);
            ThisThread::sleep_for(10ms); // wait 0.01 second
        }

        for (val = 0; val <= 1000; val++) {
            B.write((double)val / 1000.0);
            ThisThread::sleep_for(10ms); // wait 0.01 second
        }

        ThisThread::sleep_for(1000ms); // wait 1 second
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{center}

\textbf{Exercise:} Using the joystick and the LED, intelligently control
(in a manner of your choosing) the LED color using the joystick.

\hypertarget{humidity-sensor}{%
\subsubsection{4.4 Humidity Sensor}\label{humidity-sensor}}

Here is the connection for the humidity sensor illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:humidity-sensor}. Connect the signal pin to the D4 port of the processor board. The signal is digital and contains temperature and humidity information. As previously, start from an empty project.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-4cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/DHT11.png}
      \caption{Humidity sensor connection.}
      \label{fig:humidity-sensor}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

To use this sensor, we need a specific driver that we can retrieve from the environment. As before, search for a library called DHT11 at \url{https://os.mbed.com/code/}.

The first result is suitable. Copy the link address.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/17.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Then add the library by navigating to \textbf{File -> Add library to active program}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/18.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As you can see, the project now contains the driver sources for this sensor. All that's left is to write the program, based on the DHT11.h driver header file.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/19.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The header provides a constructor that takes a pin name argument and three methods: \texttt{readData} to read the sensor state, \texttt{readHumidity} to get humidity information, and \texttt{readTemperature} to get temperature information.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/20.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The following program uses the driver and continuously displays the temperature and humidity on the serial console.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"
#include "DHT11.h"

DHT11 sensor(D4); // declare the sensor on pin D4

int main()
{
    int error = 0;
    int h, t;

    printf("Starting \n\r");

    while(1) {
        ThisThread::sleep_for(2000ms);
        error = sensor.readData();
        if (error == 0) {
            t = sensor.readTemperature();
            h = sensor.readHumidity();
            printf("Temperature is: %d \n\r", t);
            printf("Humidity is: %d \n\r", h);
        } else {
            printf("Error: %d\n", error);
        }
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{connecting-the-board-to-the-network-via-wifi}{%
\subsection{5. Connecting the Board to the Network via
WIFI}\label{connecting-the-board-to-the-network-via-wifi}}

In this section, we will establish the board's connection to the internet using the integrated WiFi module through socket communication using a TCP protocol. This communication will be very useful for the next section, where we will integrate our project with the ThingSpeak cloud server.

\hypertarget{data-transmission-standards}{%
\subsubsection{5.1 Data Transmission
Standards}\label{data-transmission-standards}}

The connected device to be developed must be able to communicate with the Cloud (remote server) via a telecommunications network. These data will then be accessible via the Cloud for further processing by remote users.

There are several solutions for transmitting data from the STM32 board:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sigfox:} Sigfox is a telecommunications operator for the Internet of Things. Communications between connected objects and the Cloud via this network are unidirectional, with low data rates and very infrequent transmissions (140 messages per day). These specificities/limitations are compatible with the operating criteria of most connected objects. However, Sigfox is a paid service that only provides access to its network under a subscription.
    
    \item \textbf{LoRa:} LoRa is another LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) solution. Its communication protocol is similar to that of Sigfox except that communication is bidirectional. The data rate is higher, and the number of messages per day is not limited. The major difference between Sigfox and LoRa is that LoRa offers its services freely (free of charge).
    
    \item \textbf{WiFi:} The third solution, used in this project, involves using the WiFi module of the STM32 board. In this project, the connected object is designed to transmit data from its sensors (STM32 board) using the router present in the room as a WiFi access point or possibly your smartphone. This solution does not have the advantages of LoRa and Sigfox (long range), but it is straightforward to implement with STM32 boards.
\end{itemize}

The limitation imposed by the WiFi network (range: about twenty meters) is not to be taken into account in your proposal for a connected object. It is essential to propose a functional version of your solution (proof of concept) as well as a visual exploitation (graphical, data analysis, statistics) of the data transmitted by the STM32 board.

\hypertarget{compilation-and-launch}{%
\subsubsection{5.2 Compilation and
Launch}\label{compilation-and-launch}}

The following steps describe how to set up a communication routine from the board to an HTTP server via a WiFi network. To start:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Launch the \textit{MBed} application.
    \item Define a new project (menu File, New program).
    \item Choose the template \texttt{mbed-os-example-sockets} from the dropdown menu.
    \item Rename your program if desired (Program Name).
    \item You can use

 the \textit{MBed} environment from an existing project as shown in the following example, which saves about 1GB per project.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/21.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The created project structure is shown in the next figure. It includes the subfolder \texttt{COMPONENT\_ism43362} (driver for the WiFi chip on the STM32 board).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/22.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The \texttt{mbed\_app.json} file (in the project's root) is essential for WiFi communication. This file contains the connection parameters. The WiFi SSID and the associated PASSWORD are available in the project rooms (see the label on the WiFi routers) or you can use your own routed connection from your phone. You need to modify the values of the fields \texttt{nsapi.default-wifi-ssid} and \texttt{nsapi.default-wifi-password} by entering the name of your network and the associated password. This allows the STM32 board to connect to the internet via the WiFi network available exclusively for the IoT project.

You can compile the code as provided and verify that the connection is successful. The window at the bottom of the application should return the following messages:

As you can see, the code is written in C++ with embedded methods, which makes the code not very easy to understand. We will replace the code with its version written in C.

\hypertarget{general-code-routines-to-be-reused-everywhere}{%
\subsubsection{5.3 General Code Routines (To Be Reused
Everywhere)}\label{general-code-routines-to-be-reused-everywhere}}

Here are the details of the new code for understanding. It includes several "standard" routines and application programs.

\textbf{Inclusion of Necessary Headers}

First, include the necessary headers for using \textit{MBed} and WiFi, define a few constants, and declare three global variables which are objects defining the network to use, the address of the site to be addressed, and the socket which is the communication buffer with the site.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
#include "mbed.h"
#include "wifi_helper.h"

static constexpr size_t MAX_NUMBER_OF_ACCESS_POINTS = 10;
static constexpr size_t MAX_MESSAGE_RECEIVED_LENGTH = 100;
static constexpr size_t REMOTE_PORT = 80; // standard HTTP port

NetworkInterface *net;
SocketAddress address;
TCPSocket socket;
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{WiFi Scan Routine}

This first routine scans all available WiFi networks. It returns the number of available networks as well as the information related to each network. This routine is optional.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
void wifi_scan() {
    WiFiInterface *wifi = net->wifiInterface();
    WiFiAccessPoint ap[MAX_NUMBER_OF_ACCESS_POINTS];
    /* scan call returns number of access points found */
    int result = wifi->scan(ap, MAX_NUMBER_OF_ACCESS_POINTS);
    if (result <= 0) {
        printf("WiFiInterface::scan() failed with return value: %d\r\n", result);
        return;
    }
    printf("%d networks available:\r\n", result);
    for (int i = 0; i < result; i++) {
        printf("Network: %s secured: %s BSSID: %hhX:%hhX:%hhX:%hhx:%hhx:%hhx RSSI: %hhd Ch: %hhd\r\n",
               ap[i].get_ssid(), get_security_string(ap[i].get_security()),
               ap[i].get_bssid()[0], ap[i].get_bssid()[1], ap[i].get_bssid()[2],
               ap[i].get_bssid()[3], ap[i].get_bssid()[4], ap[i].get_bssid()[5],
               ap[i].get_rssi(), ap[i].get_channel());
    }
    printf("\r\n");
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Resolve Hostname Routine}

The following routine resolves a network name, i.e., retrieves the IP address from the site's name. The address is directly placed in the global variable \texttt{address}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
bool resolve_hostname(char *hostname) {
    /* get the host address */
    printf("\nResolve hostname %s\r\n", hostname);
    nsapi_size_or_error_t result = net->gethostbyname(hostname, &address);
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! gethostbyname(%s) returned: %d\r\n", hostname, result);
        return false;
    }
    printf("%s address is %s\r\n", hostname, (address.get_ip_address() ? address.get_ip_address() : "None") );
    return true;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Print Network Info Routine}

This routine returns information about the network to which you will connect. To use this routine, you must have previously defined the address using \texttt{resolve\_hostname}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
void print_network_info() {
    /* print the network info */
    SocketAddress a;
    net->get_ip_address(&a);
    printf("IP address: %s\r\n", a.get_ip_address() ? a.get_ip_address() : "None");
    net->get_netmask(&a);
    printf("Netmask: %s\r\n", a.get_ip_address() ? a.get_ip_address() : "None");
    net->get_gateway(&a);
    printf("Gateway: %s\r\n", a.get_ip_address() ? a.get_ip_address() : "None");
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{the-application}{%
\subsubsection{5.4 The Application}\label{the-application}}

The proposed application in this example is divided into three parts:
two routines for making requests and reading from a site, and a main
program that chains all the operations together.

\textbf{Sending an HTTP Request:}

The first routine sends an HTTP request.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  bool send_http_request() {
    /* loop until whole request sent */
    const char buffer[] = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                          "Host: ifconfig.io\r\n"
                          "Connection: close\r\n"
                          "\r\n";
    nsapi_size_t bytes_to_send = strlen(buffer);
    nsapi_size_or_error_t bytes_sent = 0;

    printf("\r\nSending message: \r\n%s", buffer);
    while (bytes_to_send) {
        bytes_sent = socket.send(buffer + bytes_sent, bytes_to_send);
        if (bytes_sent < 0) {
            printf("Error! socket.send() returned: %d\r\n", bytes_sent);
            return false;
        } else {
            printf("sent %d bytes\r\n", bytes_sent);
        }
        bytes_to_send -= bytes_sent;
    }
    printf("Complete message sent\r\n");
    return true;
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Receiving the HTTP Response:}

The following routine receives the response.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  bool receive_http_response() {
    char buffer[MAX_MESSAGE_RECEIVED_LENGTH];
    int remaining_bytes = MAX_MESSAGE_RECEIVED_LENGTH;
    int received_bytes = 0;
    /* loop until there is nothing received or we've ran out of buffer space */
    nsapi_size_or_error_t result = remaining_bytes;
    while (result > 0 && remaining_bytes > 0) {
        result = socket.recv(buffer + received_bytes, remaining_bytes);
        if (result < 0) {
            printf("Error! socket.recv() returned: %d\r\n", result);
            return false;
        }
        received_bytes += result;
        remaining_bytes -= result;
    }
    /* the message is likely larger but we only want the HTTP response code */
    printf("received %d bytes:\r\n%.*s\r\n\r\n", received_bytes, strstr(buffer, "\n") - buffer, buffer);
    return true;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{general-part-of-main.cpp}{%
\subsubsection{5.5 General Part of
main.cpp}\label{general-part-of-main.cpp}}

The beginning is relatively general as it performs network connection
operations.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
int main() {
    printf("\r\nStarting socket demo\r\n\r\n");
    // Get the default network interface instance
    net = NetworkInterface::get_default_instance();
    if (!net) {
        printf("Error! No network interface found.\r\n");
        return -1;
    }

    // If a WiFi interface is available, perform a quick network scan
    // to display visible access points
    // Comment out the code if it blocks at this step
    if (net->wifiInterface()) {
        wifi_scan();
    }

    // Connect to the network
    printf("Connecting to the network...\r\n");
    nsapi_size_or_error_t result = net->connect();
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! net->connect() returned: %d\r\n", result);
        return -1;
    }

    // Display network information (IP address, netmask, and gateway)
    print_network_info();

    // Check if the host can be found on the network
    char host[] = "ifconfig.io";
    if (!resolve_hostname(host)) {
        return -1;
    }

    // Open the socket to allocate necessary resources
    result = socket.open(net);
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! socket.open() returned: %d\r\n", result);
        return -1;
    }

    // Set the port to use for the connection
    address.set_port(REMOTE_PORT);

    // Now we need to open a connection via a socket
    printf("Opening connection to remote port %d\r\n", REMOTE_PORT);
    result = socket.connect(address);
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! socket.connect() returned: %d\r\n", result);
        return -1;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\hypertarget{specific-part-of-main.cpp}{%
\subsubsection{5.6 Specific Part of
main.cpp}\label{specific-part-of-main.cpp}}

This last part is specific to the application. Here we call the two
routines \texttt{send\_http\_request} and
\texttt{receive\_http\_response}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  // Now we can send a request and receive an HTTP response
  if (!send_http_request()) {
      return -1;
  }
  if (!receive_http_response()) {
      return -1;
  }
  // End of demonstration
  printf("Demo concluded successfully \r\n");
  return 0;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

After compiling your \texttt{main.cpp}, download the executable of the
program into the program memory space of your STM32 board. You can view
the result printed by \texttt{printf} using the communication window of
\textit{MBed Studio}, which will show either the transfers made or the
characteristics of your TCP-IP link (IP address, MAC, gateway).

\hypertarget{getting-started-with-thingspeak}{%
\subsection{6. Getting Started with
ThingSpeak}\label{getting-started-with-thingspeak}}

In this final step, we will update our previous code to establish
communication with ThingSpeak, allowing us to remotely visualize the
sensor data graphically, thus opening up new possibilities for your
projects.

\hypertarget{setting-up-a-data-collection-server-cloud}{%
\subsubsection{6.1 Setting Up a Data Collection Server
(Cloud)}\label{setting-up-a-data-collection-server-cloud}}

There are several IoT platforms dedicated to data collection. The most
popular ones are Google Cloud IoT Core, Amazon AWS IoT Core, and IBM
Watson IoT Platform. Access to these platforms' services is paid, and
the free offers they provide are limited in time. These three solutions
are easy to implement and adopted by a large community, and they have
abundant literature of usage examples.

The ThingSpeak platform by MathWorks and Ubidots are alternatives to the
first three. The capabilities offered by these two solutions are
sufficient for the scale of your project. The following describes the
setup of the ThingSpeak solution.

ThingSpeak is an open data platform for the Internet of Things. Your
device or application can communicate with ThingSpeak using a RESTful
API (Fig. \ref{fig:thingspeak}). You can either keep your data private or make it
public. Moreover, you can use ThingSpeak to analyze and act on your
data. ThingSpeak provides an online text editor for analyzing and
visualizing data using MATLAB (also by MathWorks). You can also perform
actions such as running regularly scheduled MATLAB code or sending a
tweet when your data exceeds a defined threshold. The platform's
advantages lie in performing more complex operations on datasets (via
MATLAB tools) and more advanced customization of visualized graphs.
Using such a platform can be relevant if you want to perform complex
processing of received raw data, and this for free.

At the heart of ThingSpeak is a time-series database. ThingSpeak
provides users with free storage of time-series data in channels. Each
channel can include up to eight data fields.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/ThingSpeak.png}
    \caption{Description of the communication structure via ThingSpeak.}
    \label{fig:thingspeak}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

To use ThingSpeak, follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go to the website:
  \url{https://thingspeak.com/}
\item
  Create an account (it's the same account as MATLAB if you have one).
\item
  After creating the account, create a Channel (click New Channel) in the Channels/My Channels menu. This will store your transmitted data.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-4cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/25.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  Specify your Channel attributes:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Name: StmWifi (in the chosen example below)
  \item
    Fill in the Field fields with the names of the variables used (e.g.,
    CaptX, CaptY, etc.), field1: CaptX, field2: CaptY, among others
    according to your sensors/application.
  \item
    Specify if your Channel is public or private (data confidentiality).
  \item
    Save your Channel by clicking Save Channel.

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/26.png}
      \end{center}
    \end{figure}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Identify your API Key (API keys menu of your channel). This key is
  necessary for any communication with the configured Channel on the
  ThingSpeak platform. The Write API Key will send information from the
  STM32 board to the channel, and the Read API Key will retrieve
  data/instructions to the board. These keys are uniquely associated
  with the connected object you created on the ThingSpeak platform.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/27.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  The configuration of your ThingSpeak storage channel (Cloud) is
  complete. The next steps continue on \textit{MBed OS} to create your
  program that will run on the STM32 board.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{creating-the-main-communication-file}{%
\subsubsection{6.2 Creating the Main Communication
File}\label{creating-the-main-communication-file}}

In Chapter 3, you created a project allowing the board to connect to the
WIFI network. You will start from this project and complete it. The
following describes the steps necessary to develop a communication
routine with ThingSpeak via a Wifi network.

You will modify the \texttt{main.cpp} file as follows:

At the beginning of the project, add:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The read and write access keys to your ThingSpeak channel.
\item
  Analog inputs \texttt{analog\_value0} and \texttt{analog\_value1}.
\item
  Buffers for communication (character arrays).
\item
  Variables that contain sensor data (here potentiometers).
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  NetworkInterface *net;
  SocketAddress address;
  TCPSocket socket;

  #define thingspeak_APIkey_write "GS80MF8P8K3S5DD4" // put your channel's write API key
  #define thingspeak_APIkey_read "QEM41UTCNZQ03M0E"  // put your channel's read API key

  AnalogIn analog_value0(A0);
  AnalogIn analog_value1(A1);

  nsapi_error_t response;

  char sbuffer[256];
  char message[64];
  float captX;
  float captY;
  float captZ;
\end{lstlisting}

The following part of \texttt{main.cpp} does not change. Resume from the
moment of defining the site's address as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  char hostname[] = "api.thingspeak.com";
  if (!resolve_hostname(hostname)) {
      return -1;
  }
  address.set_port(REMOTE_PORT);
\end{lstlisting}

Then enter an infinite loop. Start by opening a socket and connecting to
the ThingSpeak site address:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  while (true) {
    // We now need to open a connection to a socket
    result = socket.open(net);
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! socket.open() returned: %d\r\n", result);
        return -1;
    }
    printf("\r\n\r\nOpening connection to remote port %d\r\n", REMOTE_PORT);
    result = socket.connect(address);
    if (result != 0) {
        printf("Error! socket.connect() returned: %d\r\n", result);
        return -1;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Read the value provided by the sensors:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  captX = analog_value0.read();
  captY = analog_value1.read();
  captZ = 0;
\end{lstlisting}

Create a message from the previous data to send to ThingSpeak:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  // message to be transmitted (sensor data)
  sprintf(message, "{\"field1\": %0.2f, \"field2\": %0.2f, \"field3\": %0.2f}", captX, captY, captZ);
  printf("Message = %s\r\n", message);
  // Data transmission phase to ThingSpeak.com
  sprintf(sbuffer, "GET /update?api_key=%s HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: api.thingspeak.com\r\nContent-Type: application/json\r\nContent-Length: %d\r\n\r\n%s", thingspeak_APIkey_write, (int)strlen(message), message);
  printf("HTTP command %s\r\n", sbuffer);
\end{lstlisting}

Then verify that the request was received successfully:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  printf("Sending HTTP request to thingspeak.com...\n");
  nsapi_size_t size = strlen(sbuffer);
  response = 0;
  while (size) {
      response = socket.send(sbuffer + response, size);
      if (response < 0) {
          printf("Error sending data: %d\n", response);
          socket.close();
          return -1;
      } else {
          size -= response;
      }
  }
  printf("request sent to thingspeak.com...\n");
\end{lstlisting}

Next, wait to receive the response from the ThingSpeak site and display the received response:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  // Receive a simple HTTP response and print out the response line
  char rbuffer[64];
  response = socket.recv(rbuffer, sizeof rbuffer);
  if (response < 0) {
      printf("Error receiving data: %d\n", response);
  } else {
      printf("recv %d [%.*s]\n", response, strstr(rbuffer, "\r\n") - rbuffer, rbuffer);
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, close the socket and sleep for 5 seconds:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  // Close the socket to return its memory and bring down the network interface
  socket.close();
  ThisThread::sleep_for(5000ms); // wait for 5 seconds
}
net->disconnect();

return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

You can now compile your code and execute it. You can view the result
printed by \texttt{printf} in the communication window, either the
transfers made or the characteristics of your TCP-IP link (IP address,
MAC, gateway).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/28.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Furthermore, your data can be directly viewed through the ThingSpeak
interface.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/29.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

For advanced data processing, you will find a set of tools in the MATLAB
Analysis and MATLAB Visualization categories. Before going further in
your project, modify the API to retrieve data from ThingSpeak to the
STM32 board.

\hypertarget{chapter-3-introduction-to-STM32CubeIDE}{%
\section{Chapter 3: Introduction to
STM32CubeIDE}\label{chapter-3-introduction-to-STM32CubeIDE}}

The integrated development environment (IDE) developed by
STMicroelectronics previously consisted of several separate software
tools, such as \textit{STM32CubeIDE} for writing code,
\textit{STM32CubeMX} for configuring the microcontroller, and
\textit{STM32CubeProgrammer} for programming and debugging it. Today,
all these tools are integrated into \textit{STM32CubeIDE}, simplifying the
product line and creating a single tool capable of performing all the
necessary tasks to develop your project.

In this section, we will discuss the basic configurations of a project
using \textit{STM32CubeIDE}, as it has a completely different interface from \textit{MBed
OS}. Additionally, we will use the second board mentioned earlier, the
\texttt{B-U585I-IOT02A}, to prepare for the following chapters where we
will need a board with greater processing power and memory. We will
initially demonstrate a simple project and then create a TCP
communication protocol with the ThingSpeak server.

\hypertarget{the-basics-of-STM32CubeIDE}{%
\subsection{1. The Basics of
STM32CubeIDE}\label{the-basics-of-STM32CubeIDE}}

For this first example, we will simply make an LED blink. Although
simple, this example will be very useful for any other project
configuration you might undertake. Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Download and install the latest version of the software (install
  directly on your C: drive, before the \texttt{users} folder to avoid
  path issues in your projects):
  \href{https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/STM32CubeIDE.html}{\texttt{STM32CubeIDE\ Download}}.
\item
  Open \textit{STM32CubeIDE}. A window will appear for you to choose your
  workspace directory. Just click \textbf{Launch} to use the default.
\item
  Create a new project via \textbf{File -\textgreater{} New
  -\textgreater{} STM32 Project}.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/37.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  A new window will appear for you to name your project and choose some
  other options. Name it as you wish and leave the rest as default,
  especially the choice of the C language.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/61.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Next, we need to select whether we are configuring only a
  microcontroller or an STMicroelectronics board that already has some
  peripherals. Since we are working with the \texttt{B-U585I-IOT02A}, we
  will select it in the \textbf{Board Selector} and search for its part
  number. After clicking \textbf{Finish}, you will be asked if you would
  like to initialize the peripherals of your board. Click \textbf{Yes}
  to pre-configure the various modules connected to the
  microcontroller's pins, making our work easier as we won't have to
  define them one by one.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/43.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  You will then see your development environment, with the central
  window being the \textit{STM32CubeMX} showing your microcontroller chip and its
  pins.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/40.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

As stated by STMicroelectronics, ``\textit{STM32CubeMX} is a graphical
tool that allows a very easy configuration of STM32 microcontrollers and
microprocessors, as well as the generation of the corresponding
initialization C code for the Arm¬Æ Cortex¬Æ-M core or a partial Linux¬Æ
Device Tree for Arm¬Æ Cortex¬Æ-A core, through a step-by-step process.''

This software is used to graphically configure pins, timers, clocks,
connection types, communication protocols, and pre-installed packages,
among many other functions found on the left side of the window, as
shown in the image below.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/41.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

After this pre-configuration, it is possible to generate partially
written code containing the initializations for all selected
peripherals, defined pins, and necessary libraries, making the creation
of your projects much easier as you won't need to write each line
manually and can focus on the main part of your code.

When we created our project, all peripherals were initialized, which is
why some pins are already pre-configured (green pins).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/43.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Now, let's start configuring our microcontroller so we can use what we
define here in our code.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  For our first example of blinking an LED present on the board, we
  would define one of the microcontroller pins as \texttt{output} and
  name it to make it easier to read in our code. However, since we
  initialized these components, the LED is already configured on pin
  \texttt{PH6} (left-click on the pin to access these definitions), as
  well as its label (right-click on the pin and select
  \texttt{Enter\ User\ Label}), which you can change to whatever name
  you want.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.27\textwidth]{images/63.png}}
    \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.3075\textwidth]{images/64.png}}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Now we will configure the clock of our microcontroller, which will be
  used by many of its tools. To do this, select the top \textbf{Clock
  Configuration} tab. The large amount of information in this window may
  seem overwhelming initially, but we will only modify a few parameters.
  First, select the \texttt{High-Speed\ Internal\ Clock} (HSI) in the
  \texttt{PLL\ Source\ Mux}, set \texttt{HCLK\ (MHz)} to the maximum
  allowed (160 MHz), press Enter, and wait for the software to find the
  best solution for your configuration, which should look similar to the
  values on the right in the photo below (red box 4).

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/48.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  After this, we can save our project with \texttt{Ctrl\ +\ S} or
  \textbf{File -\textgreater{} Save}, and a window will appear asking if
  you would like to generate the automatic code for your configurations.
  Click \textbf{Yes}. If this window does not appear, you can also click
  on the \textbf{Device Configuration Tool Code Generation} item in the
  toolbar at the top of the screen.
\end{enumerate}

The \textit{STM32CubeIDE} can auto-generate parts of your code based on
the configuration you did previously in \textit{STM32CubeMX}, such as if
a pin is an output or input, the type of communication used, and many
other parameters. The generated code includes various comments defining
the safe zones for users to write their code, which are delimited by
\texttt{USER\ CODE\ BEGIN} and \texttt{USER\ CODE\ END}, as shown in the
image below where these areas were highlighted. If the user writes
outside these zones, regenerating the code will retain only the lines
within the safe zones, and the rest will be deleted. Therefore, always
write within the designated areas, which is not difficult as there are
multiple such areas in different parts of the code.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/42.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Now, just add the necessary code in these safe zones. To make the LED
blink, place the following lines inside the loop of the \texttt{while}
present in \texttt{main()}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
      /* USER CODE END WHILE */
      HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(LED_RED_GPIO_Port, LED_RED_Pin);
      HAL_Delay(1000);
      /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  /* USER CODE END 3 */
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, build your project in \textbf{Project -\textgreater{} Build
Project} and then upload it to the board. Connect the board to your
computer and then go to \textbf{Run -\textgreater{} Run} and observe the
red LED blinking on your board. You can also implement the green LED in
your project, as it is already configured.

As mentioned earlier, \textit{STM32CubeIDE} is not very
``beginner-friendly'' due to the numerous functions, configurations, and
parameters without simplified explanations. However, it is a powerful
tool that allows full control over the microcontroller used, without
needing to work directly with registers, and can speed up the coding
process due to the automatic code generation.

For more in-depth information and a simpler, straightforward language, I
strongly recommend Mitch Davis's YouTube channel, especially the video

\hypertarget{timer-and-trigger-management-in-STM32CubeIDE-projects}{%
\subsection{2. Timer and Trigger Management in STM32CubeIDE
Projects}\label{timer-and-trigger-management-in-STM32CubeIDE-projects}}

In embedded systems, especially when working with microcontrollers like
the STM32, understanding timers and triggers is crucial. Timers are
integral components that allow microcontrollers to perform operations at
precise intervals, which is essential for tasks such as creating delays,
measuring time intervals, generating PWM signals, and managing
time-sensitive events.

\hypertarget{understanding-stm32-timers-and-triggers}{%
\subsubsection{2.1 Understanding STM32 Timers and
Triggers}\label{understanding-stm32-timers-and-triggers}}

\textbf{Timers:}

Timers in microcontrollers are essentially counters that increment or
decrement at a specific frequency, derived from the system clock. The
STM32 microcontrollers feature multiple timers, each with unique
capabilities and configurations. The key parameters and features of
timers include:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Counter Mode}: Timers can operate in different modes such as
  up-counting, down-counting, or center-aligned mode. In up-counting
  mode, the timer counts from 0 to a predefined value, while in
  down-counting, it counts down to 0. Center-aligned mode combines both,
  which is useful for PWM generation.
\item
  \textbf{Prescaler}: The prescaler divides the system clock to slow
  down the timer frequency. This allows for more extended timing
  intervals and precise control over the timer's operation.
\item
  \textbf{Auto-Reload Register (ARR)}: This register determines the
  period of the timer. When the counter reaches the value in the ARR, it
  resets to 0 (or the predefined start value), triggering an event if
  configured.
\item
  \textbf{Interrupts}: Timers can generate interrupts when they reach
  specific values, such as the overflow or underflow points. These
  interrupts can be used to execute specific functions at regular
  intervals, essential for time-critical applications.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Triggers:}

Triggers are signals or events that cause the timer to start, stop,
reset, or capture the current counter value. In the STM32
microcontrollers, various trigger sources can be used to control timers:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Internal Triggers}: These are signals generated within the
  microcontroller, such as other timers or specific events from
  peripherals like ADCs or DACs. For instance, Timer 1 can trigger Timer
  2, creating synchronized events between different timers.
\item
  \textbf{External Triggers}: These come from external pins or hardware
  events outside the microcontroller. An external button press, for
  instance, can start or reset a timer.
\item
  \textbf{Software Triggers}: The timer can also be controlled
  programmatically through software commands. This is useful for precise
  control over the timing without relying on external events.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Practical Applications:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Delay Generation}: Timers can create precise delays by
  configuring the counter and using interrupts to execute code at set
  intervals.
\item
  \textbf{PWM Generation}: Timers are often used to generate PWM signals
  for motor control, LED dimming, and communication protocols.
\item
  \textbf{Event Timing}: Timers can measure the time between events,
  which is crucial in applications requiring precise time measurements,
  such as pulse width measurement.
\item
  \textbf{Periodic Task Execution}: Using timer interrupts, tasks can be
  executed periodically, essential for real-time operating systems and
  other time-critical applications.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{pwm-signal-generation-example}{%
\subsubsection{2.3 PWM Signal Generation
Example}\label{pwm-signal-generation-example}}

Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals are a fundamental feature in
microcontroller applications, particularly when precise control over
power delivery or signal generation is required. PWM signals are
essentially digital signals that alternate between on and off states at
a high frequency. The key parameter in a PWM signal is the duty cycle,
which represents the proportion of time the signal is high (on) compared
to the total period of the cycle.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/60.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{PWM Configuration Steps:}

Configuring PWM signals on STM32 microcontrollers using STMCubeMX is a
straightforward process. First, you need to select the appropriate timer
that will generate the PWM signals. STM32 microcontrollers typically
come with several timers, each capable of generating multiple PWM
signals (you must see in the datasheet which pin can be configured as
PWM generator, because this can change from each MCU).

Once you have selected the timer, the next step is to configure the PWM
channels. In STMCubeMX, navigate to the timer configuration settings and
enable the PWM mode for the desired channels. Here, you can specify the
frequency of the PWM signal by setting the timer's prescaler and
auto-reload register (ARR) values. The frequency is determined by the
formula:

\[
    \text{PWM Frequency} = \frac{\text{Timer Clock}}{(\text{Prescaler} + 1) \times (\text{ARR} + 1)}
\]

After setting the frequency, you can configure the duty cycle for each
PWM channel. The duty cycle is set by adjusting the compare register
(CCR) value for each channel. The duty cycle percentage is calculated as
follows:

\[
    \text{Duty Cycle (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Compare Value}}{\text{ARR}} \right) \times 100
\]

For example, if the ARR is set to 999 and the compare value is set to
499, the duty cycle will be 50\%.

Here is a simple configuration of a Timer as a PWM generator:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Configure TIM3 or another suitable timer to operate in PWM mode with
  CH1 (and also CH2 in the configuration below).

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/57.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  In Configuration, set the parameters you need for your application.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/58.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  Generate initialization code and integrate it into your project.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{handling-pwm-signals-with-deadtimes}{%
\subsubsection{2.4 Handling PWM Signals with
Deadtimes}\label{handling-pwm-signals-with-deadtimes}}

Deadtimes are essential in many applications involving switching
devices, such as in PWM generation for motor control or power inverters.
Deadtime refers to a brief delay introduced between the turning off of
one transistor and the turning on of another in switching circuits. This
delay prevents two switches from being on simultaneously, which could
lead to a direct short circuit through the power supply, potentially
damaging the components or reducing their lifespan due to excessive
current.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/59.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Configuring Deadtimes:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In \textit{STM32CubeMX}, navigate to the timer configuration.
\item
  Locate the deadtime settings under PWM Generation mode.
\item
  Set appropriate deadtime values to ensure safe operation of your
  PWM-driven systems.
\end{itemize}

You can also see this tutorial from STMicroelectronics on how to
configure deadtimes in you projects using a complementary PWM mode:

\hypertarget{connecting-to-thingspeak}{%
\subsection{3. Connecting to
ThingSpeak}\label{connecting-to-thingspeak}}

In this section, we will demonstrate an application where a TCP/IP
protocol is implemented between the board, which contains an integrated
WiFi module, and the ThingSpeak server. This enables online data
visualization and processing using MATLAB, similar to how it was used in
section
\protect\hyperlink{getting-started-with-thingspeak}{\texttt{6}} of
Chapter 2.

We will start with a project created by \texttt{STMicroelectronics}
available on the following \texttt{GitHub} link:
\href{https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeU5/tree/main}{\texttt{https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeU5}}.

In the mentioned repository, you will find the \texttt{Readme} which
outlines the correct method for downloading the file. If this procedure
is not followed correctly, you will not be able to build your project
due to version and file location issues. Following the procedure, you
should clone the repository using the following command in the terminal
within your \textit{STM32CubeIDE} project folder. Choose the location
carefully, as projects created with \textit{STM32CubeIDE} cannot simply
be copied, pasted, or moved due to the need for correctly defined file
paths:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashStyle]
  git clone --recursive https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeU5.git
\end{lstlisting}

Additionally, we must use the most updated firmware version available at
the moment, which for me is \texttt{v1.5.0}. This can be verified in the
\href{https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeU5/blob/master/Release_Notes.html}{\texttt{Release\ Notes\ for\ STM32CubeU5\ Firmware\ Package}}.
Replace X.Y.Z with your version and run this command inside the
\texttt{STM32CubeU5} folder you just cloned:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=BashStyle]
  git checkout vX.Y.Z # Specify the targeted vX.Y.Z version
\end{lstlisting}

In the \texttt{STM32CubeU5} repository, there are examples and
demonstration projects using all U5 series boards developed by
\texttt{STMicroelectronics}, applying various libraries and integrated
modules of the boards. One of these projects uses the
\texttt{MXChip} WiFi module on the \texttt{B-U585I-IOT02A} for TCP/IP
communication with a server.

We will use this base project, modifying the server to
\texttt{ThingSpeak} and sending a fixed value that can be visualized on
the website. The project is located in the following path in the folder
where you downloaded it:
\texttt{STM32CubeU5/Projects/B-U585I-IOT02A/Applications/NetXDuo/Nx\_UDP\_Echo\_Client}.

We will not provide the complete project due to the mentioned issue of
file path incompatibility, but we will include the files that will be
modified in the following folder:

\begin{center}
  \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/chapter-3/STM32CubeU5}{\faFolder\texttt{\ chapter-3/STM32CubeU5}}
\end{center}

\hypertarget{updating-the-wifi-module-firmware}{%
\subsubsection{3.1 Updating the WiFi Module
Firmware}\label{updating-the-wifi-module-firmware}}

Before starting the project, you need to update the firmware of the
\texttt{EMW3080} module, the \texttt{MXChip} WiFi module on our board,
to version \texttt{2.3.4} found here:
\href{setup/en.x-wifi-emw3080b.zip}{\texttt{setup/en.x-wifi-emw3080b.zip}}.

Download the file and follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Extract the file.
\item
  Navigate to
  \texttt{en.x-wifi-emw3080b\textbackslash{}V2.3.4\textbackslash{}SPI\textbackslash{}EMW3080update\_B-U585I-IOT02A-RevC\_V2.3.4\_SPI.bin}.
\item
  Connect your \texttt{B-U585I-IOT02A} board to your computer via USB.
\item
  Drag the file to the disk drive that appears on your computer upon
  connecting the board. In my case, it is \texttt{DIS\_U585AI}.
\item
  Open a serial terminal, such as \textit{PuTTY} or the \textit{MBed}
  terminal used earlier, with the following settings: baud rate 115200
  bits/s, 8-bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit, no flow control (some
  programs only require the baud rate, like \textit{MBed}).
\item
  Restart the board by pressing the black button and monitor the
  terminal to see if the firmware enters boot mode.
\item
  You will see a message similar to the one below (if you don't see it,
  reinitialize your terminal and after do the same to the board). Simply
  press the blue user button on the board and wait for the update to
  apply. It might take a while to initialize, so be patient.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/52.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\end{enumerate}

Now, your module's firmware is updated, and you can proceed with the
tutorial.

\hypertarget{understanding-the-base-project-and-its-configurations}{%
\subsubsection{3.2 Understanding the Base Project and Its
Configurations}\label{understanding-the-base-project-and-its-configurations}}

Before modifying the original project for our application, let's first
understand how it works. We can add the project to our \textit{STM32CubeIDE} by
navigating to
\texttt{Projects/B-U585I-IOT02A/Applications/NetXDuo/Nx\_UDP\_Echo\_Client/\textit{STM32CubeIDE}}
and double-clicking the \texttt{.cproject} file or by going to
\textit{STM32CubeIDE}, selecting \textbf{File -\textgreater{} Open project from
file system}, navigating to the directory containing the
\texttt{.cproject} file, and clicking \texttt{Finish}.

The \texttt{Nx\_TCP\_Echo\_Client} application serves as a practical
example of utilizing the Azure RTOS \textit{NetX/NetXDuo} stack to create a TCP
client that communicates with a remote server. This example is
structured to help developers understand the implementation of TCP/IP
communication in an embedded system using STM32 microcontrollers.

\textbf{Overview of the Project:}

By opening the \texttt{.ioc} file, which is the \textit{STM32CubeMX}
configuration file for graphical pin and peripheral configuration, or
simply examining the files in the project folders, you will notice the
use of two main packages. These packages bring various functionalities
and libraries to the project, enabling the implementation of diverse
applications. The packages used here are \textit{ThreadX} and
\textit{NetXDuo}, where the latter depends on the former to function
properly.

\textbf{ThreadX} is a real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for
embedded systems. It provides essential services such as thread
management, inter-thread communication, and synchronization, ensuring
efficient task execution and resource management.

\textbf{NetX/NetXDuo} is a high-performance TCP/IP network stack
tailored for \textit{ThreadX}. It facilitates robust network communication in
embedded applications, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols. \textit{NetXDuo}
extends the capabilities of \textit{NetX} with enhanced features.

This project integrates \textit{ThreadX} and \textit{NetX/NetXDuo} to create a TCP echo
client. It demonstrates how these components can be effectively implemented
to develop sophisticated networked applications on STM32
microcontrollers. The objective is to implement a TCP client that sends
messages to a server and receives corresponding responses, which are
then printed on a terminal.

The main codes for this application that we will analyze are the ones
present in:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{Nx\_TCP\_Echo\_Client/Core/Inc/app\_threadx.h}
\item
  \texttt{Nx\_TCP\_Echo\_Client/NetXDuo/App/app\_netxduo.c}
\end{itemize}

As you can see, all the implemented code will be done outside of
\texttt{main.c} since we will be working with threads. The code for the
threads can be implemented in \texttt{app\_threadx.c} or
\texttt{app\_netxduo.c}. This is evident from the image below, where
once the code reaches \texttt{main()}, the function
\texttt{MX\_ThreadX\_Init()} is called, and the scheduler takes control
from there, so the code never reaches the \texttt{while} loop.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/53.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Therefore, if you want to create your own application after this
tutorial, you should implement it within one of the already created
threads or create your own, taking into account the communication and
synchronization between the threads. Also, we suggest that you use this
project as a base for your own, especially if you plan to use the TCP
protocol in your program. Start with this project and add your libraries
and code, because there is a significant dependency on files, libraries,
and drivers to work with this WiFi module.

\textbf{Initialization and Thread Creation:}

The application's main entry point is the
\texttt{tx\_application\_define()} function, which \textit{ThreadX} calls during
kernel start-up. This function is responsible for creating all the
necessary \textit{NetX} resources and initializing the system. The sequence of
initialization includes creating a packet pool, setting up an IP
instance, enabling various protocols (ARP, ICMP, UDP, and TCP), and
creating a DHCP client.

In the provided codes, the \texttt{MX\_ThreadX\_Init()} function starts
the \textit{ThreadX} kernel by calling \texttt{tx\_kernel\_enter()}, initiating
the kernel operations. Then, \texttt{MX\_NetXDuo\_Init()} handles the
initialization of \textit{NetX} resources.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  void MX_ThreadX_Init(void) {
    tx_kernel_enter();
  }
\end{lstlisting}

In \texttt{MX\_NetXDuo\_Init()}, memory for various components is
allocated, and the system is initialized. For instance, the packet pool
is created using \texttt{nx\_packet\_pool\_create()}, and the IP
instance is created with \texttt{nx\_ip\_create()}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  ret = nx_packet_pool_create(&AppPool, "Main Packet Pool", PAYLOAD_SIZE, pointer, NX_PACKET_POOL_SIZE);
  ret = nx_ip_create(&IpInstance, "Main Ip instance", NULL_ADDRESS, NULL_ADDRESS, &AppPool, nx_driver_emw3080_entry, pointer, 2 * DEFAULT_MEMORY_SIZE, DEFAULT_PRIORITY);
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Thread Execution:}

Two threads are created: \texttt{AppMainThread} and
\texttt{AppTCPThread}, both having the same priority.
\texttt{AppMainThread} starts automatically (\texttt{TX\_AUTO\_START}),
while \texttt{AppTCPThread} is started later (\texttt{TX\_DONT\_START}).

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  ret = tx_thread_create(&AppMainThread, "App Main thread", App_Main_Thread_Entry, 0, pointer, 2 * DEFAULT_MEMORY_SIZE, DEFAULT_PRIORITY, DEFAULT_PRIORITY, TX_NO_TIME_SLICE, TX_AUTO_START);
  ret = tx_thread_create(&AppTCPThread, "App TCP Thread", App_TCP_Thread_Entry, 0, pointer, 2 * DEFAULT_MEMORY_SIZE, DEFAULT_PRIORITY, DEFAULT_PRIORITY, TX_NO_TIME_SLICE, TX_DONT_START);
\end{lstlisting}

\texttt{AppMainThread} is responsible for starting the DHCP client,
waiting for the IP address resolution, and then resuming
\texttt{AppTCPThread}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  static VOID App_Main_Thread_Entry(ULONG thread_input) {
    nx_ip_address_change_notify(&IpInstance, ip_address_change_notify_callback, NULL);

    tx_semaphore_get(&Semaphore, TX_WAIT_FOREVER);
    tx_thread_resume(&AppTCPThread);
    tx_thread_relinquish();
  }
\end{lstlisting}

\texttt{AppTCPThread} handles the TCP communication. It creates a TCP
socket, connects to a remote server, sends a series of messages, and
receives responses. Upon successful communication, it prints the
responses to the terminal and toggles a green LED to indicate success.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]

\subsubsection{3.3 Implementing Communication with
ThingSpeak}\label{implementing-communication-with-thingspeak}}

Based on the code examples shown earlier, we will now set up our own
communication with the ThingSpeak server by primarily modifying the
mentioned files: \texttt{app\_threadx.c} and \texttt{app\_netxduo.c}.
Additionally, some changes will be required in other files. To access
these files, it's easier to use your computer's file explorer rather
than \textit{STM32CubeIDE}'s, as it may not display all files present within
folders.

But before making the modifications mentioned later, I recommend
building your project and checking for any errors related to library
path issues, for example. To do this, go to \textbf{Project
-\textgreater{} Build Project} and wait for the process to complete. At
the end, you should see a message indicating that your build encountered
0 errors. If not, delete the repository and redo the cloning procedure
mentioned in section
\protect\hyperlink{connecting-to-thingspeak}{\texttt{3}}.

After certifying that everything is working, the first step is to add
your WiFi SSID and password so the module can connect to the internet.
Navigate to \texttt{Nx\_TCP\_Echo\_Client/Core/Inc/mx\_wifi\_conf.h} and
modify the following lines by adding your network information:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  #define WIFI_SSID           "YOUR_SSID"
  #define WIFI_PASSWORD       "YOUR_PASSWORD"
\end{lstlisting}

You can connect using a network created by your smartphone or a router,
as long as it's not an enterprise network requiring additional
information beyond network and password, such as Eduroam.

Next, define the ThingSpeak server information and the data you want to
send. First, create a new channel on the ThingSpeak website as described
in section
\protect\hyperlink{getting-started-with-thingspeak}{\texttt{6}} of
Chapter 2, and note down your Write API key. Then, modify the file
located at \texttt{Nx\_TCP\_Echo\_Client/NetXDuo/App/app\_netxduo.h}:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  #define PAYLOAD_SIZE             1544
  #define NX_PACKET_POOL_SIZE      (( PAYLOAD_SIZE + sizeof(NX_PACKET)) * 10)
  #define WINDOW_SIZE              512
  
  #define DEFAULT_MEMORY_SIZE      1024
  #define DEFAULT_PRIORITY         10
  
  #define NULL_ADDRESS             0
  
  #define DEFAULT_PORT             6000
  #define TCP_SERVER_PORT          80  // Port 80 for HTTP
  #define TCP_SERVER_ADDRESS       IP_ADDRESS(184, 106, 153, 149) // ThingSpeak server IP
  
  #define DEFAULT_TIMEOUT          10 * NX_IP_PERIODIC_RATE
  #define THINGSPEAK_API_KEY       "Q7G63OMFJK1H2T5W" // Write key
  #define THINGSPEAK_FIELD_VALUE   100  // Value we want to send
\end{lstlisting}

In this code snippet, we added the ThingSpeak server information such as
port, server IP, and our Write API key. Additionally, we defined a value
(\texttt{THINGSPEAK\_FIELD\_VALUE}) to send to the server, which in this
case is 100 but could represent a value read from a sensor, for example.

Now, we proceed to \texttt{app\_netxduo.c}, where we will handle
communication with the server. Since we are using the TCP protocol, we
won't need to modify thread creation or DHCP client initialization.
Therefore, we will only adjust \texttt{App\_TCP\_Thread\_Entry()} while
explaining each part of what this thread will do. A better way to see
the code is in this path:

completion.
\item
Sleeps for 4000 clock ticks (\texttt{tx\_thread\_sleep(4000)})
before restarting the loop for continuous communication with
ThingSpeak.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This function continuously sends HTTP GET requests to the ThingSpeak
server, retrieves responses, and handles them appropriately, ensuring
reliable communication using TCP/IP. It includes error handling and
operates periodically with a sleep interval of 4000 clock ticks. In my
case, a sleep of 4000 was sufficient for the server to receive all
packets. If this number were smaller, data transmission would be faster,
but the server might not handle the influx and fail to update its
database.

This implementation provides a straightforward approach for such
communication logic, suitable for small-scale applications like ours.

With these modifications made, simply build the project via
\textbf{Project -\textgreater{} Build Project} and run it in debug mode
via \textbf{Run -\textgreater{} Debug}. You can monitor the entire
initialization, transmission, and reception process in a terminal, as
shown below, where the terminal output precedes the result on the
ThingSpeak website.

Devices}\label{chapter-4-integrating-ai-into-edge-devices}}

\hypertarget{overview-of-embedded-ai}{%
\subsection{1. Overview of Embedded AI}\label{overview-of-embedded-ai}}

Embedded AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence
capabilities into devices or systems, often known as edge applications.
This enables tasks involving machine learning to be performed locally,
without the need for external computational resources such as cloud
services.

The primary advantages of this approach include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Reduced Latency}: Due to the proximity of the processing unit
  to the task.
\item
  \textbf{Low Bandwidth Usage}: Minimal data transmission requirements.
\item
  \textbf{Low Power Consumption}: Optimized for energy efficiency.
\item
  \textbf{Network Independence}: Operates without constant internet
  connectivity.
\item
  \textbf{High Performance}: Capable of handling demanding tasks
  efficiently.
\end{itemize}

Devices with embedded AI are becoming increasingly common and diverse.
Examples include smart cameras that can process images in real-time,
voice assistants that understand and respond to commands without delay,
industrial robots that adapt to their environments, autonomous vehicles
that navigate without human intervention, and various IoT devices that
perform complex tasks independently. These systems use AI algorithms
to enhance their capabilities, making them smarter and more efficient.

In this chapter, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of edge AI
using microcontrollers. This knowledge will enable you to integrate your
own models into the topics discussed in previous chapters, allowing you
to create a complete network. With this approach, you can:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Build Custom Data Acquisition Systems}: Use sensors to gather
  data in real-time.
\item
  \textbf{Analyze Data Locally}: Implement your own neural networks on
  microcontrollers to process and analyze data on-site.
\item
  \textbf{Automate Device Control}: Use the analysis results to trigger
  actions in other devices and components.
\item
  \textbf{Cloud Integration for Monitoring}: Connect to the cloud only
  to remotely monitor and visualize the collected data and analysis
  results.
\end{itemize}

To better understand embedded AI and the usage of \textit{STM32CubeIDE}
for this application, which, as mentioned earlier, can be somewhat
complex for new users, we will implement a very simple neural network
(NN) model that has been previously developed. Therefore, we will not
delve into the concepts of developing your own NN and will mainly focus
on the software usage. However, the model used, developed in
\texttt{Google\ Colab}, is present in the following path:

\begin{center}
  \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/chapter-4/tflite_sinewave_training.ipynb}{\faFolder\texttt{\ chapter-4/tflite\_sinewave\_training.ipynb}}
\end{center}

The developed model is capable of approximating the sine value of a
given number using a cloud of random points without using trigonometric
operations. As we will see at the end of this tutorial, the obtained
value will not be exact, as this method is inefficient for determining
the sine of a number. However, it will be very useful for you to easily
understand the implementation of AI in microcontrollers.

This tutorial is based on the material developed by \texttt{DigiKey} and
is available at:
\href{https://www.digikey.fr/en/maker/projects/tinyml-getting-started-with-stm32-x-cube-ai/f94e1c8bfc1e4b6291d0f672d780d2c0}{\texttt{TinyML:\ Getting\ Started\ with\ STM32\ X-CUBE-AI}}

\hypertarget{exporting-the-model}{%
\subsection{2. Exporting the Model}\label{exporting-the-model}}

The first step is to export your model in the \texttt{.tflite} format to
be used in our application. This type of file is generated through the
TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) toolkit, an open-source library developed by
Google for deploying machine learning models to edge devices.

TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight version of TensorFlow designed for
mobile and embedded devices. It enables the deployment of machine
learning models on resource-constrained platforms like smartphones,
microcontrollers, and IoT devices. TFLite models are optimized for low
latency and low power consumption. You can convert TensorFlow models to
TFLite format using the TFLite Converter, which applies optimizations
such as quantization.

Quantization is a technique used in machine learning and digital signal
processing to reduce the precision of the numbers representing a model,
typically from floating-point to integer values. This process helps to
decrease the model size, reduce memory usage, and improve computational
efficiency, particularly important for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices like microcontrollers and mobile phones.

So, we need to follow these steps to have our model in \texttt{.tflite}
format:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  First, we will import our \texttt{tflite\_sinewave\_training.ipynb}

  You will then have \textit{STM32CubeMX} interface.

\hypertarget{project-configuration}{%
\subsection{5. Project Configuration}\label{project-configuration}}

Having covered the basics of the software from the previous chapter and
the recommended videos, we can now proceed with configuring our project.

For this tutorial, we will not use any pins as input or output. We will
use serial communication to print information on the terminal and verify
the operation of our code. Normally, it would be necessary to configure
one of the \texttt{UART} ports for serial communication, but this has
already been initialized and is connected through the
\texttt{micro-USB\ ST-Link} for a direct connection to the computer
using a baud rate of 115200 Bits/s.

Follow these steps to configure our project:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In the \texttt{Timers} tab, activate \texttt{TIM16} so that it ticks
  every microsecond. To do this, select \texttt{TIM16}, check
  \texttt{Activated} in \textbf{Mode}, and in the \textbf{Configuration}
  tab, set the \texttt{Prescaler} to meet our requirement of ticking
  every microsecond (160-1=159 for a system clock of 160 MHz) and set
  the \texttt{AutoReload\ register} to its maximum (65535 for a 16-bit
  timer). For a better understanding of how timers work, see section
  \protect\hyperlink{timer-and-trigger-management-in-STM32CubeIDE-projects}{\texttt{2}}
  of Chapter 3.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/44.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Next, we will add the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} package to the project. Click
  on \textbf{Software Packs} and then on \textbf{Select Components}, and
  a new window will appear. Search for the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} package
  and, as mentioned earlier during its installation, choose version
  \texttt{5.2.0} and activate the \texttt{Core}. If the installed
  version does not appear, remove and reinstall it using the same method
  described in section
  \protect\hyperlink{installing-the-x-cube-ai-package}{\texttt{3}},
  save the project, choose not to generate the code, restart the
  software, and see if the correct version appears.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/45.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Now let's configure the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} package. Select the
  \texttt{Middleware\ and\ Software\ Packs} tab and click on
  \texttt{X-CUBE-AI}. Activate the package in \textbf{Mode}, and in
  \textbf{Configuration}, click on \texttt{Add\ network} and add the
  model in \texttt{.tflite} format generated through \texttt{Colab} with
  the name that will be used by its functions in the code you will write
  later.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/46.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  After configuring the model, we can compress it to fit in our
  microcontroller. As previously mentioned, the memory required to run a
  given model may exceed the available memory on the microcontroller.
  However, since our example is very small, it will not require this
  configuration. We can then analyze the model and verify that
  everything is correct by clicking on \texttt{Analyze}, which will show
  some parameters about the model, such as its complexity and the
  necessary \texttt{Flash} and \texttt{RAM} memory sizes for its
  implementation. The \texttt{Show\ graph} option will display a
  graphical view of your model. The desktop and target validation
  options can be used to validate the application of your model but will
  not be covered at this time.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/47.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Now we will configure the clock of our microcontroller the same way we
  did in Chapter 3. To do this, select the top \textbf{Clock
  Configuration} tab. Select the \texttt{High\ Speed\ Internal\ Clock}
  (HSI) in the \texttt{PLL\ Source\ Mux}, set \texttt{HCLK\ (MHz)} to
  the maximum allowed (160 MHz), press Enter, and wait for the software
  to find the best solution for your configuration, which should look
  similar to the values on the right in the photo below (red box 4).

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/48.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  The final configuration step is the \textbf{Project Manager}. Select
  the top tab with the same name and then \textbf{Code Generator}, click
  on
  \texttt{Add\ necessary\ library\ files\ as\ referenced\ in\ the\ toolchain\ project\ configuration\ file},
  and uncheck the option
  \texttt{Delete\ previously\ generated\ files\ when\ not\ re-generated}.
  Save the project and select to generate code in the window that
  appears.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-2cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/49.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
\item
  Now, your project is configured, and your initial code is generated.
  Ensure that you have the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} and \texttt{Middlewares}
  folders in your \textbf{Project Explorer} on the left. If these
  folders are missing, you may have incorrectly configured the required
  version of \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} or selected the wrong options in the
  \textbf{Project Manager}.

  If these folders are not present, follow these troubleshooting steps:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Reinstall X-CUBE-AI}: Go back to the \textbf{Manage Embedded
    Software Packages} under \textbf{Help} and ensure that version
    \texttt{5.2.0} of \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} is installed. If not, reinstall
    it as described in section
    \protect\hyperlink{installing-the-x-cube-ai-package}{\texttt{3}}.
  \item
    \textbf{Verify Project Manager Settings}: Double-check the settings
    in the \textbf{Project Manager} to ensure all necessary options are
    selected. Specifically, make sure
    \texttt{Add\ necessary\ library\ files\ as\ referenced\ in\ the\ toolchain\ project\ configuration\ file}
    is checked, and
    \texttt{Delete\ previously\ generated\ files\ when\ not\ re-generated}
    is unchecked. If you continue with the problem, you can try to
    choose the other options in this same tab in the
    \texttt{packages\ and\ embedded\ software\ packs} and
    \texttt{generated\ files} sections.
  \item
    \textbf{Generate Code Again}: Save your project and regenerate the
    code. Ensure no errors are present during the generation process.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

By following these steps, you should have your project correctly set up
with all necessary libraries and configurations, allowing you to proceed
with developing your embedded AI application on the
\textit{STM32CubeIDE}.

\hypertarget{writing-the-code}{%
\subsection{6. Writing the Code}\label{writing-the-code}}

After configuring the project and generating the code, we move on to
developing our programming logic. The complete code is available in the
provided folder, but don't just copy and paste it completely, because
the generated code can change based on the microprocessor, your project
configuration, or even the IDE and package versions used. Therefore,
only copy and paste within the safe zones mentioned earlier.

\begin{center}
  \href{https://github.com/Mateushga1/AIoT-Guidebook/blob/main/chapter-4/B-U585I-IOT02A-sine-model/Core/Src/main.c}{\faFolder\texttt{\ chapter-4/B-U585I-IOT02A-sine-model/Core/Src/main.c}}
\end{center}

\textbf{Including Libraries:}

The first step is to add the necessary headers.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* Private includes ----------------------------------------------------------*/
  /* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */
  #include <stdio.h>
  
  #include "ai_datatypes_defines.h"
  #include "ai_platform.h"
  #include "sine_model.h"
  #include "sine_model_data.h"
  /* USER CODE END Includes */
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{stdio.h}: Standard C library for using the \texttt{printf}
  command.
\item
  \textbf{sine\_model.h}: Contains the main functions we will use in our
  code. You can access them by hovering over the \texttt{include} and
  clicking while holding the \texttt{CTRL} key.
\item
  \textbf{sine\_model\_data.h}: Represents our neural network in byte
  format.
\end{itemize}

The remaining libraries are generated by \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} and include
functions we will use to integrate our model into the code.

Note that \texttt{sine\_model.h} and \texttt{sine\_model\_data.h} use
the same name given to the model during the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI}
configuration. If you named it differently, you must use that name here
and in other functions below.

\textbf{Global Variables and Initializations:}

After the includes, we declare global variables and initialize some
structures critical for the neural network operation on the STM32
microcontroller.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
  char buf[50];
  int buf_len = 0;
  ai_error ai_err;
  ai_i32 nbatch;
  uint32_t timestamp;
  float y_val;
  
  // Chunk of memory used to hold intermediate values for neural network
  AI_ALIGNED(4) ai_u8 activations[AI_SINE_MODEL_DATA_ACTIVATIONS_SIZE];
  
  // Buffers used to store input and output tensors
  AI_ALIGNED(4) ai_i8 in_data[AI_SINE_MODEL_IN_1_SIZE_BYTES];
  AI_ALIGNED(4) ai_i8 out_data[AI_SINE_MODEL_OUT_1_SIZE_BYTES];
  
  // Pointer to our model
  ai_handle sine_model = AI_HANDLE_NULL;
  
  // Initialize wrapper structs that hold pointers to data and info about the
  // data (tensor height, width, channels)
  ai_buffer ai_input[AI_SINE_MODEL_IN_NUM] = AI_SINE_MODEL_IN;
  ai_buffer ai_output[AI_SINE_MODEL_OUT_NUM] = AI_SINE_MODEL_OUT;
  
  // Set working memory and get weights/biases from model
  ai_network_params ai_params = {
  AI_SINE_MODEL_DATA_WEIGHTS(ai_sine_model_data_weights_get()),
  AI_SINE_MODEL_DATA_ACTIVATIONS(activations)
  };
  
  // Set pointers wrapper structs to our data buffers
  ai_input[0].n_batches = 1;
  ai_input[0].data = AI_HANDLE_PTR(in_data);
  ai_output[0].n_batches = 1;
  ai_output[0].data = AI_HANDLE_PTR(out_data);
  /* USER CODE END 1 */
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Memory Buffers}: \texttt{activations}, \texttt{in\_data}, and
  \texttt{out\_data} are memory buffers that store intermediate data,
  inputs, and outputs of the neural network, respectively.
\item
  \textbf{Model Pointer}: \texttt{sine\_model} is a pointer that will
  reference the neural network instance.
\item
  \textbf{Input and Output Structures}: \texttt{ai\_input} and
  \texttt{ai\_output} are structures that hold pointers to the input and
  output data, as well as information about tensor dimensions.
\item
  \textbf{Network Parameters}: \texttt{ai\_params} contains the weights,
  biases, and activations of the neural network, essential for
  initializing the model.
\item
  \textbf{Buffer Configuration}: The lines defining
  \texttt{ai\_input{[}0{]}.n\_batches} and
  \texttt{ai\_output{[}0{]}.n\_batches} configure these buffers to
  receive one batch of data.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Neural Network Initialization:}

Next, we initialize the timer and set up the neural network:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */
  // Start timer/counter
  HAL_TIM_Base_Start(&htim16);
  
  // Greetings!
  buf_len = sprintf(buf, "\r\n\r\nSTM32 X-Cube-AI test\r\n");
  HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)buf, buf_len, 100);
  
  // Create instance of neural network
  ai_err = ai_sine_model_create(&sine_model, AI_SINE_MODEL_DATA_CONFIG);
  if (ai_err.type != AI_ERROR_NONE)
  {
      buf_len = sprintf(buf, "Error: could not create NN instance\r\n");
      HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)buf, buf_len, 100);
      while(1);
  }
  
  // Initialize neural network
  if (!ai_sine_model_init(sine_model, &ai_params))
  {
      buf_len = sprintf(buf, "Error: could not initialize NN\r\n");
      HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)buf, buf_len, 100);
      while(1);
  }
  /* USER CODE END 2 */
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Timer Initialization}:
  \texttt{HAL\_TIM\_Base\_Start(\&htim16)} starts a timer used to
  measure the neural network inference time.
\item
  \textbf{Welcome Message}: \texttt{sprintf} and
  \texttt{HAL\_UART\_Transmit} send an initial message via UART,
  confirming that the system is operational.
\item
  \textbf{Neural Network Instance Creation}:
  \texttt{ai\_sine\_model\_create} creates an instance of the neural
  network. If an error occurs, an error message is transmitted, and the
  system enters an infinite loop.
\item
  \textbf{Neural Network Initialization}: \texttt{ai\_sine\_model\_init}
  initializes the neural network with the parameters defined earlier. If
  initialization fails, an error message is transmitted, and the system
  enters an infinite loop.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Main Loop:}

Finally, we have the main loop of the code, where inference is
continuously performed:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
      // Fill input buffer (use test value)
      for (uint32_t i = 0; i < AI_SINE_MODEL_IN_1_SIZE; i++)
      {
      ((ai_float *)in_data)[i] = (ai_float)2.0f;
      }
  
      // Get current timestamp
      timestamp = htim16.Instance->CNT;
  
      // Perform inference
      nbatch = ai_sine_model_run(sine_model, &ai_input[0], &ai_output[0]);
      if (nbatch != 1) {
      buf_len = sprintf(buf, "Error: could not run inference\r\n");
      HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)buf, buf_len, 100);
      }
  
      // Read output (predicted y) of neural network
      y_val = ((float *)out_data)[0];
  
      // Print output of neural network along with inference time (microseconds)
      buf_len = sprintf(buf,
                      "Output: %f | Duration: %lu\r\n",
                      y_val,
                      htim16.Instance->CNT - timestamp);
      HAL_UART_Transmit(&huart1, (uint8_t *)buf, buf_len, 100);
  
      // Wait before doing it again
      HAL_Delay(500);
  
  /* USER CODE END WHILE */
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Fill Input Buffer}: The \texttt{for} loop fills the input
  buffer \texttt{in\_data} with a test value (2.0f) for inference.
\item
  \textbf{Timestamp}: \texttt{timestamp} stores the current timer value
  before inference to measure execution time.
\item
  \textbf{Inference}: \texttt{ai\_sine\_model\_run} performs the neural
  network inference. If it returns a value other than 1, it indicates an
  error.
\item
  \textbf{Read Result}: \texttt{y\_val} stores the output value of the
  neural network.
\item
  \textbf{Send Result}: \texttt{sprintf} and
  \texttt{HAL\_UART\_Transmit} send the result and inference time via
  UART.
\item
  \textbf{Delay}: \texttt{HAL\_Delay(500)} creates a 500 ms pause before
  the next inference.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Handling Float in \texttt{printf}}

You will notice an error when adding the line to print the output of the
neural network along with the inference time. In \textit{STM32CubeIDE},
the \texttt{printf} function does not support float values by default.
To fix this, we need to change the project settings.

Go to \textbf{Project -\textgreater{} Properties -\textgreater{} C/C++
Build -\textgreater{} Settings}, select the \textbf{Configuration}
\texttt{Debug} and in \textbf{MCU GCC Linker -\textgreater{}
Miscellaneous}, add \texttt{-u\_printf\_float} in \textbf{Other flags}.
Repeat this for the \texttt{Release} \textbf{Configuration}. Finally,
click \texttt{Apply\ and\ Close} and save your program.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-1cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/50.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Now, in \textbf{Project -\textgreater{} Build Project}, you can compile
your code and see if there are any errors. With these steps, your code
is ready to run the neural network on the STM32 microcontroller,
allowing you to observe the outputs and performance metrics via
\texttt{UART}. This code will infer the \texttt{sin(2.0)} in radians and
provide the approximate value based on the results obtained during the
model training.

\hypertarget{debugging-and-uploading-to-stm32}{%
\subsection{7. Debugging and Uploading to
STM32}\label{debugging-and-uploading-to-stm32}}

To ensure that our code functions correctly and everything is as
expected, we will run it in \texttt{Debug} mode. Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Navigate to \textbf{Run -\textgreater{} Debug}.
\item
  In the \textbf{Confirm Perspective Switch} window that appears, press
  \textbf{Switch}.
\item
  Finally, click \textbf{Resume} in the top toolbar (or press F8).
\end{enumerate}

Next, open a serial terminal to observe your code running on the
microcontroller. While I will use the terminal in \textit{Mbed Studio},
you may prefer a dedicated terminal application such as \texttt{PuTTY}.
Select the correct port and set the baud rate to 115200 Bits/s. You
should see an output similar to the image below:

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/51.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As shown in the example, my model inferred an output of 0.8899 for
\texttt{sin(2.0)}, which is relatively close to the actual value of
0.9093. This result is acceptable for demonstrating the procedure, but
the training could be improved to enhance the accuracy of the inference.

We can also run our code in \texttt{Release} mode on our
microcontroller. This mode excludes certain files used by the
\texttt{Debug} mode and employs a different compiler optimizer, reducing
the code size and potentially improving inference time. To do this:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Stop the \texttt{Debug} mode if it is still running by clicking the
  \textbf{Terminate} button in the superior toolbar.
\item
  Navigate to \textbf{Project -\textgreater{} Build Configurations
  -\textgreater{} Set Active -\textgreater{} Release}.
\item
  Click \textbf{Run -\textgreater{} Run Configurations}. In that window,
  in the left pane, click on the \textbf{New Launch Configuration
  button}, which should create a new configuration named
  \texttt{project\_name\ Release}.
\item
  In the \texttt{Main} tab, select \textbf{Search Project} and select
  your \texttt{project\_name/Release/project\_name.elf} file from the
  bottom pane. Click \textbf{OK}. Select \texttt{Release} for your
  \textbf{Build Configuration}. Click \textbf{Apply} and \textbf{Run}.
\item
  Check your terminal output.
\end{enumerate}

In this case, the differences were minimal (only 1 microsecond faster
inference time), but depending on the size of your code,
functionalities, and the microcontroller used, the impact may be more
significant.

\hypertarget{performance-analysis}{%
\subsection{8. Performance Analysis}\label{performance-analysis}}

After confirming that the model runs correctly on the microcontroller,
it is possible to analyze its performance, particularly when executing multiple
inferences. For this, you will use an application provided by the
\texttt{X-CUBE-AI} package. However, some modifications to the project
will be necessary, so you must start by a new one.

This performance metric analysis procedure is based on the tutorial
developed by \texttt{ST~Microelectronics}, which is available here:
\href{https://wiki.st.com/stm32mcu/index.php?title=AI:How_to_measure_machine_learning_model_power_consumption_with_STM32Cube.AI_generated_application\&direction=prev\&oldid=24537\#}{How
to measure machine learning model power consumption with STM32Cube.AI
generated application}.

Follow these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Start a new project, select the same development board, assign a name,
  and choose not to initialize the peripherals. This will be important
  to minimize unnecessary power consumption.
\item
  Once the STM32CubeMX interface opens, add the \texttt{X-CUBE-AI}
  package as before. However, this time, also add the system performance
  application.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/65.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}
  
\item
  In \textbf{Middlewares and Software Packs -\textgreater{} Platform
  Settings}, identify the port that \texttt{X-CUBE-AI} uses to
  communicate with the board. Since the development board has an STLink
  connector, which is the USB port used for connecting to the computer,
  simply identify which serial port is connected to this connector. To
  find this, refer to the datasheet for your board. For the
  \texttt{B-U585I-IOT02A}, it is \texttt{USART1}.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/66.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  Next, disable all unused pins to prevent interference with the board's
  power consumption analysis. This will ensure that only the essential
  peripherals and the model are consuming power. To do this,
  right-click on each pin and select \textbf{Reset\_State}, which will
  remove the default configurations, except for the Rx and Tx pins,
  which will be used for serial communication with the computer (these
  are the two green pins with a pin icon in the images below).

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{images/67.png}}
    \subfigure{\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{images/68.png}}
  \end{figure}

\item
  The next step is to import the model as done previously, but this
  time, also access the advanced settings and enable the two options
  shown below. Afterward, analyze your model to ensure everything is
  correct and that no errors are present.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/69.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  The final project configuration will be in \textbf{Project Manager
  -\textgreater{} Code Generator}, where you need to apply the following
  modifications. Finally, save your project and generate the code.

  \begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics[width=\dimexpr\textwidth-1cm\relax,height=\dimexpr0.25\textheight-3cm\relax,keepaspectratio]{images/70.png}
    \end{center}
  \end{figure}

\item
  Once the code is generated, a few modifications will be necessary. The
  first is to create a function to disable the GPIO clock during power
  measurement. To do this, create the function below. It will vary
  depending on the board you are using, so the best approach is to find
  the \texttt{MX\_GPIO\_Init} function in your \texttt{main.c}, copy its
  contents, keep the pin names, and replace the function name with
  \texttt{Disable}. Also, verify if the UART communication via STLink
  found earlier is still \texttt{USART1}; if not, replace
  \texttt{HAL\_UART\_DeInit(\&huart1)} and adjust the microcontroller
  pins in \texttt{GPIO\_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO\_PIN\_9\textbar{}GPIO\_PIN\_10}.

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  /* Private user code ---------------------------------------------------------*/

  Next, go to the
  \texttt{X-CUBE-AI/App/app\_x-cube-ai.c} file and replace the entire
  \texttt{ai\_mnetwork\_run} function with the updated version shown
  below:

  \textbf{Original:}

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  AI_API_ENTRY
  ai_i32 ai_mnetwork_run(ai_handle network, const ai_buffer* input,
          ai_buffer* output)
  {
      struct network_instance* inn;
      inn =  ai_mnetwork_handle((struct network_instance *)network);
      if (inn)
          return inn->entry->ai_run(inn->handle, input, output);
      else
          return 0;
  }
  \end{lstlisting}

  \textbf{Modified:}

  \begin{lstlisting}[style=CStyle]
  extern void MX_UARTx_DeInit(void);
  extern void MX_GPIO_Disable(void);
  #define AI_MIN_LOOP 16

  AI_API_ENTRY
  ai_i32 ai_mnetwork_run(ai_handle network, const ai_buffer* input, ai_buffer* output)
  {
      struct network_instance* inn;
      static ai_i32 Counter = 0;
      inn =  ai_mnetwork_handle((struct network_instance *)network);
      if (inn == NULL)
          return 0;
      if (Counter < AI_MIN_LOOP)
      {
          Counter++;
          return inn->entry->ai_run(inn->handle, input, output);
      }
      else
      {
          printf("\nStarting infinite power measurement loop\n");
          MX_UARTx_DeInit();
          MX_GPIO_Disable();
          while(1)
          {
              inn->entry->ai_run(inn->handle, input, output);
          }
      } 
  }
  \end{lstlisting}

\item
  Save the project, build it, and upload it to the board. You'll also
  need to use a terminal, such as PuTTY or TeraTerm, to monitor the
  serial communication. Open the software and configure it as follows:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Port: the STM32 COM port number
  \item
    Speed: 115200 bits/s
  \item
    Data bits: 8
  \item
    Parity: None
  \item
    Stop bits: 1
  \item
    Flow control: None
  \end{itemize}

\item
  Finally, remove the \texttt{JP3} jumper from your board and connect the multimeter probes in current measurement mode to the two exposed connectors. The \texttt{JP3} jumper, labeled IDD, is used to measure the STM32 microcontroller's power consumption, the level shifter, and the SMPS (depending on the solder-bridge configuration). When the jumper is \texttt{ON}, the board is powered directly (default), but when it is \texttt{OFF}, a multimeter or an external 3.3 V power source must be connected to measure the microcontroller's consumption.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\item
  With everything configured and connected, power on your board, press the reset button, and observe the measurements in the terminal.

\end{enumerate}

The main measurements to observe are inference time and energy consumption by the model. In this tutorial, the model consumes 8.71 mA, with the same inference time as previously measured, 28 ms. As this is a very simple model, the consumption may not seem significant, but for more complex models, this consumption could be much higher, potentially causing issues depending on your application.
